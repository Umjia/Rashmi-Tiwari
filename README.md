#Assignment Question:
Implement the solution for sorting the array in which each element is defined as [a,b] for example [2,3].
Input: "1": Result: Sorted array: on value "a"
Input: "2": Result: Sorted array on value "b"

For this assignment I took a and b as individual arrays a1 and a2.

first using a for loop ,I inserted values in the array a1 and a2

And then using a switch statement I carried out the soring when input/choice was one

the array a1 was sorted and when input/choice was 2 array a2 was sorted.


Output:

Enter number of elements in array:3

Enter a1[0] and a2[0] : 1 9

Enter a1[1] and a2[1] : 3 8

Enter a1[2] and a2[2] : 2 10

Array:
[1,9]

[3,8]

[2,10]

Enter choice:1

Sort on the basis of first element :

[1,9]

[2,10]

[3,8]


Enter number of elements in array:3

Enter a1[0] and a2[0] : 1 6

Enter a1[1] and a2[1] : 3 9

Enter a1[2] and a2[2] : 2 4

Array:

[1,6]

[3,9]

[2,4]

Enter choice:2

Sort on the basis of second element

[2,4]

[1,6]

[3,9]


Conclusion : I first tried to solve it using a matrix but i got stuck so i used this different approach.I got to revise my concepts of sorting
             through this assignment
